* [Full documentation](https://dimitrisk.github.io/goal/index.html)

## Description

<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

This is an R library for the **analysis** of geographical data. It includes 4 group of functions:

1) functions for the analysis of networks (`net`).   

2) functions for spatial-geometry conversions (`geo`).   

3) functions for geographical visualization and interpretation of statistics (`vis`).  

4) functions for analysis of UAV missions and flightpaths (`uav`).

5) functions for OpenStreetMap data analysis (`osm`).

6) functions for Spatial Analysis (`spa`).




## Installation

You can install goal from  GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("dimitrisk/goal")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(goal)
 
```

 
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
